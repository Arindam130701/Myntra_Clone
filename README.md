Myntra Clone – React E-Commerce Application
This project is a frontend clone of the popular fashion e-commerce platform Myntra built using React.js and JavaScript. It replicates the core shopping experience including product listing, product details, and cart functionality.
The main objective of this project was to strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals such as component-based architecture, state management using Hooks, routing, and dynamic rendering.
