**Myntra Clone – React E-Commerce Application**

This project is a frontend clone of the popular fashion e-commerce platform Myntra built using React.js and JavaScript. It replicates the core shopping experience including product listing, product details, and cart functionality.
The main objective of this project was to strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals such as component-based architecture, state management using Hooks, routing, and dynamic rendering.

**Add to Cart Functionality**

The Add to Cart feature allows users to select products and add them to their shopping cart seamlessly. When a user clicks the “Add to Cart” button, the selected product is stored in the cart state and dynamically displayed in the cart page.

Key Features:
Adds selected product to cart using React state management
Prevents duplicate entries by increasing quantity if product already exists
Allows users to increase or decrease product quantity
Removes product from cart
Automatically updates total price based on quantity changes
Uses conditional rendering to show empty cart message
